\usage{
lss_with_hrf_pure_r(
  Y,
  onset_idx,
  durations = NULL,
  hrf_basis_kernels,
  coefficients,
  Z = NULL,
  Nuisance = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  method = c("r", "cpp", "cpp_arma", "cpp_omp")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{numeric matrix (n_time x n_vox)}

\item{onset_idx}{integer vector (length n_trials), 1-based TR indices}

\item{durations}{numeric vector (length n_trials), in TRs; 0 means an impulse.
Uses inclusive indexing: if duration = d, samples \code{o:(o+d)} are 1.}

\item{hrf_basis_kernels}{numeric matrix (L x K), K basis kernels on TR grid}

\item{coefficients}{numeric matrix (K x n_vox), voxel-wise HRF weights}

\item{Z}{optional numeric matrix (n_time x F) of experimental regressors;
if NULL, an intercept (column of 1s) is used.}

\item{Nuisance}{optional numeric matrix (n_time x q) of confounds to project out}

\item{verbose}{logical; print progress every 1000 voxels}

\item{method}{character: "r" (default, pure R), "cpp" (C++ backend), 
"cpp_arma" (Armadillo backend), or "cpp_omp" (OpenMP parallel backend).
Falls back automatically: cpp_omp -> cpp_arma -> cpp -> r.}
}
\value{
numeric matrix (n_trials x n_vox) of trial-wise beta estimates
}
\description{
Compute LSS trial-wise betas when each voxel has its own HRF formed
as a linear combination of K basis kernels sampled on the TR grid.
}
\details{
**Design & nuisance handling match `lss()`**:
  - The trial-of-interest (Xi) and the sum of all other trials (Xother) are
    included in each per-trial GLM.
  - If `Nuisance` is supplied, it is projected out of **Y** and the trial
    regressors before LSS (standard residualization). Experimental regressors
    `Z` are *not* residualized, matching `lss()` documentation.
  - If `Z` is `NULL`, an intercept-only design is used.
