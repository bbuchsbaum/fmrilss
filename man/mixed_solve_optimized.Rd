  Z,
  Y,
  K = NULL,
  workspace = NULL,
  compute_se = FALSE,
  n_threads = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Fixed effects design matrix (n × p)}

\item{Z}{Random effects design matrix (n × q)}

\item{Y}{Response data - can be a vector (single voxel) or matrix (n × V for multiple voxels)}

\item{K}{Kinship/covariance matrix for random effects (q × q). Defaults to identity.}

\item{workspace}{Precomputed workspace (optional, will compute if NULL)}

\item{compute_se}{Whether to compute standard errors (default: FALSE)}

\item{n_threads}{Number of OpenMP threads for multi-voxel (0 = auto)}
}
\value{
List with estimated parameters and variance components
}
\description{
An optimized implementation of mixed model estimation that precomputes
expensive matrix operations and can be reused across multiple voxels
for significant performance improvements.
