\title{Optimized multi-voxel mixed model estimation}
\usage{
mixed_multi_voxel_cpp(Y, ws_list, compute_se = FALSE, n_threads = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Response matrix (n Ã— V) where V is number of voxels}

\item{ws_list}{Precomputed workspace (as R list)}

\item{compute_se}{Whether to compute standard errors}

\item{n_threads}{Number of OpenMP threads (0 = auto)}
}
\value{
List with matrices of estimates across voxels
}
\description{
Uses precomputed workspace and parallel processing to efficiently
estimate mixed models across many voxels.
