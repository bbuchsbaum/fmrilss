\title{Precompute Workspace for Optimized Mixed Model}
\usage{
mixed_precompute(X, Z, K = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Fixed effects design matrix (n × p)}

\item{Z}{Random effects design matrix (n × q)}

\item{K}{Kinship/covariance matrix for random effects (q × q)}
}
\value{
Workspace object for use with mixed_solve_optimized
}
\description{
Performs expensive matrix computations that don't depend on the response
vector, allowing for efficient reuse across multiple voxels.
