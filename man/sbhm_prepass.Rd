\usage{
sbhm_prepass(
  Y,
  sbhm,
  design_spec,
  Nuisance = NULL,
  prewhiten = NULL,
  ridge = list(mode = "fractional", lambda = 0.01, alpha_ref = NULL),
  data_fac = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix T×V of fMRI time series.}

\item{sbhm}{SBHM object from `sbhm_build()` (must contain B, S, A, tgrid, span).}

\item{design_spec}{List describing events (same shape as `oasis$design_spec`).
Must contain `sframe` and `cond` with `onsets` (and optional `duration`,
`amplitude`, `span`). `cond$hrf` is ignored and replaced with `sbhm_hrf`.
Optional `others` (list of other conditions) will be aggregated as nuisances.}

\item{Nuisance}{Optional T×P nuisance matrix (motion, drift, etc.).}

\item{prewhiten}{Optional fmriAR prewhitening options (see `?lss`). If provided,
Y and design are prewhitened together.}

\item{ridge}{Optional list for targeted ridge shrinkage in the prepass solve:
- `mode`: "fractional" (default) or "absolute". Fractional scales by mean(diag(G)).
- `lambda`: nonnegative scalar (default 0.01 in fractional mode).
- `alpha_ref`: r-vector to shrink towards (default `sbhm$ref$alpha_ref`).}

\item{data_fac}{Optional list for external factorization: `scores` (T×q),
`loadings` (q×V). If provided, computes X'Y via (X'Scores) × Loadings. In this
PR2 version, prewhitening is not applied when `data_fac` is used.}
}
\value{
List with:
  - `beta_bar` r×V aggregate coefficients
  - `A_agg`   T×r aggregated per-basis design (after any residualization/whitening)
  - `G`       r×r crossprod of A_agg
  - `diag`    list with K=r, ntrials, times, used_prewhiten
}
\description{
Compute per-voxel coefficients in the shared SBHM basis by fitting a single
aggregate GLM with one regressor per basis column (trials summed), optionally
residualizing by nuisances and prewhitening. This produces `beta_bar` (r×V)
that you can feed to `sbhm_match()`.
}
\details{
Notes:
- Aggregated per-basis regressors can be highly collinear, making G = A' A
  ill-conditioned. A small ridge is recommended for stability. The default
  uses fractional mode with `lambda = 0.01` (scaled by mean(diag(G))).
- When `data_fac` is provided (factorized data path), prewhitening is skipped
  in this version; both dense and factorized paths perform nuisance
  residualization consistently.
