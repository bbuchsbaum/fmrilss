\title{Least Squares All (LSA) Analysis}
\usage{
lsa(Y, X, Z = NULL, Nuisance = NULL, method = c("r", "cpp"))
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix where rows are timepoints and columns are 
voxels/features. This is the dependent variable data.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows are timepoints and columns are 
trial-specific regressors. Each column represents a single trial or event.}

\item{Z}{A numeric matrix of nuisance regressors (e.g., motion parameters,
drift terms). Defaults to NULL.}

\item{Nuisance}{An alias for Z, provided for consistency with LSS interface.
If both Z and Nuisance are provided, Z takes precedence.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the computational method:
\itemize{
  \item "r" - Pure R implementation using lm.fit
  \item "cpp" - C++ implementation for better performance
}}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of size T × V containing the beta estimates for
  each trial regressor (rows) and each voxel (columns).
}
\description{
Performs a standard multiple regression analysis where all trial regressors
are fitted simultaneously. This provides a reference comparison to the 
Least Squares Separate (LSS) approach.
}
\details{
LSA fits the model: Y = X*beta + Z*gamma + error, where all trial regressors
in X are estimated simultaneously. This is in contrast to LSS, which fits
each trial separately while treating other trials as nuisance regressors.

\examples{
n_timepoints <- 100
n_trials <- 10
n_voxels <- 50

X <- matrix(0, n_timepoints, n_trials)
for(i in 1:n_trials) {
  start <- (i-1) * 8 + 1
  if(start + 5 <= n_timepoints) {
    X[start:(start+5), i] <- 1
  }
}

Y <- matrix(rnorm(n_timepoints * n_voxels), n_timepoints, n_voxels)
true_betas <- matrix(rnorm(n_trials * n_voxels, 0, 0.5), n_trials, n_voxels)
for(i in 1:n_trials) {
  Y <- Y + X[, i] \%*\% matrix(true_betas[i, ], 1, n_voxels)
}

beta_estimates <- lsa(Y, X)
